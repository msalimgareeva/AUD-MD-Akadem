# Description 

Akademichesky district was selected for the analysis because some of the first Khrushchevkas are located here, and there were many experimental areas constructed in the 1950s-1960s in this district or nearby.
Nowadays, there is a mixture of Stalin and panel buildings and many educational institutions in this area. 
A district is in close proximity to the city centre, but is not considered as part of it, so it is in between of the center and outskirts. 
Many panel buildings have already been demolished in the area during the first demolition program initiated in 1998, and there are new residential complexes next to older housing.
This area and nearby districts are also known for a strong community of residents (active facebook group,local protests and meetings).
First step of the analysis was to look at the socio-economic profile of the district and compare this data to neighbouring districts on the map of Moscow.
The district is located in part of the city with relatively high percentage of people with higher education. 
Akademichesky district has significantly lower percentage than Gagarinsky district, and acts as a buffer between more prestigious districts located closer to the city center and the outskirts with lower level of education. 
The percentage of young population in both Akademichesky and Gagarinsky is low compared to the rest of the city, and percent of old population is high.
Next step was to focus more on housing aspect in the area. Two types of data have been used for this step: subjective data (from Mechanics of Moscow survey) and objective (from Reforma ZHKH website).
Descriptive analysis of survey responses of different districts of Moscow showed that residents of Akademichesky district are more likely to complain about housing problems than average district in Moscow.
At the same time, higher percent of people in Akademichesky said that they are involved in different types of activities to improve their neighbourhood, but many people said they are not involved at all. 
Analysis of the objective data confirmed the assumption that the area has a diverse profile of building ages and typologies.
Number of floors of buildings is clearly connected to the period of construction: buildings from the 1950s-1960s have only 5 floors. 
Buildings of the Stalin period are higher and reach up to 14 floors, while the highest are the most recently constructed houses.
In terms of buildings design, most buildings constructed after 1955 are standardised. 
Following the overview of housing characteristics in the area, the research focused on Khruschev period housing specifically. Five-storey buildings constructed in 1955-1965 have been mapped.
Analysis of transport accessibility (walking distance to closest public transport stop and trip duration to the city center) showed that some buildings are located in more advantageous positions than other, but there is no clear trend, since the comparison of within just one district.
Heat maps of transport accessibility, amenities and social network activity showed that there are no clear centers of activity in the area, and concentration of activity is relatively evenly spread throughout the area.  
Typologies of places, derived from data, indicate that outdoor spaces and retail are the most represented types of facilities in the area. The rest of categories showed similar frequencies.
Overall, the analysis showed that Akademichesky district has rather diverse urban fabric where buildings constructed in 1955-1965 play an important role of a skeleton of the district, as many amenities and points of activities overlap with these buildings.
